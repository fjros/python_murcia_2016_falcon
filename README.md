A primer on Falcon
==================

This repo contains the code and slides of a short talk given at the
[Python Murcia](http://www.meetup.com/es-ES/Meetup-de-Python-en-Murcia/) meetup in May 2016. The
objective is to introduce REST API development via [Falcon](http://falconframework.org) through
some simple examples.

You can spin up a virtual server with the environment employed during the talk:

* Install Vagrant and the following plugins

```bash
vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
```

* Provision the virtual server

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fjros/python_murcia_2016_falcon
cd python_murcia_2016_falcon/
vagrant up
```

* Log into the server and run the sample application

```bash
vagrant ssh
```

```bash
PYTHONPATH=/vagrant:$PYTHONPATH gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:8000 music:api
```
